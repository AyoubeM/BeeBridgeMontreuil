  "faq_heading": "Everything About Bee Bridges Interactive",
  "faq_q1": "Where does the name Bee Bridges Interactive come from?",
  "faq_r1": "Our name carries a dual meaning that guides our vision. \"Bee\" represents teamwork and collective creation. It also resonates with the Bambara word \"bɛɛ\", meaning \"everyone\". Combined with \"Bridges\", it embodies our mission: \"Everyone together on the bridges\" — creating connections between cultures, genres, and media through engaging video games expanded into authentic transmedia experiences.",
  "faq_q2": "\"Hey, isn’t this the same team as Blind Bend Studio?\"",
  "faq_r2": "Yes, that’s us! Bee Bridges Interactive represents the evolution of our passion, with a renewed vision to share our creations with an even wider audience.",
  "faq_q3": "What makes your transmedia approach unique?",
  "faq_r3": "Unlike a simple adaptation, we design stories from the start to live across multiple media. The video game is the core experience, but key story elements can be found in a comic, a podcast… creating a coherent and rich narrative ecosystem.",
  "faq_q4": "Is diversity at the heart of all your projects?",
  "faq_r4": "Yes, because it reflects the real world. It’s not a “topic” but a foundation. Our characters and universes are built to entertain first, while representing human complexity.",
  "faq_q5": "What is your next game?",
  "faq_r5": "We are currently developing \"Blind Frontiers\", our next immersive narrative experience. Learn more at www.blindfrontiers.com",
  "faq_q6": "Where can I follow your latest news?",
  "faq_r6": "Instagram, TikTok, Discord, LinkedIn, and our newsletter are the best ways to follow our announcements, behind-the-scenes content, and transmedia updates.",
  "faq_q7": "Are you hiring? Do you offer internships?",
  "faq_r7": "We announce all our opportunities (jobs, discovery internships) on our social platforms. If no active offer is visible, it means we cannot welcome new talent at the moment — but we truly appreciate your interest.",
  "faq_q8": "Do you accept collaborations with other creators?",
  "faq_r8": "Absolutely! We’re always open to partnerships with artists, musicians, or other studios whose vision aligns with ours. Contact us through our form or at contact@beebridgesinteractive.com."
