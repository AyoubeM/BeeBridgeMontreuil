  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_heading": "Everything About Bee Bridges Interactive",

  "faq_q1": "Where does the name Bee Bridges Interactive come from?",
  "faq_r1": "Our name carries a double meaning that guides our vision. “Bee” symbolizes teamwork and collective creation. It also echoes the Bambara word “bɛɛ,” meaning “everyone.” Combined with “Bridges,” it embodies our mission: “Everyone together on the bridges” — creating connections between cultures, genres, and media through authentic video game and transmedia experiences.",

  "faq_q2": "\"Hey, isn’t this the same team as Blind Bend Studio?\"",
  "faq_r2": "Yes, it is! Bee Bridges Interactive represents the evolution of our passion, with a renewed vision to share our creations with an even wider audience.",

  "faq_q3": "What makes your transmedia approach unique?",
  "faq_r3": "Unlike a simple adaptation, we design stories from the start to live across multiple media. The video game is the core experience, but key elements can be discovered in a comic, a podcast… creating a rich and coherent narrative ecosystem.",

  "faq_q4": "Is diversity at the heart of all your projects?",
  "faq_r4": "Yes, because it reflects the real world. It is not a 'theme' but a foundation. Our characters and universes are built to entertain first while representing human complexity.",

  "faq_q5": "What is your next game?",
  "faq_r5": "We are currently developing “Blind Frontiers”, our next immersive narrative experience. Learn more at: www.blindfrontiers.com",

  "faq_q6": "Where can I follow your latest updates?",
  "faq_r6": "Instagram, TikTok, Discord, LinkedIn, and our newsletter are the best ways to follow our announcements, behind-the-scenes content, and transmedia updates.",

  "faq_q7": "Are you hiring? Do you offer internships?",
  "faq_r7": "All our opportunities (jobs, discovery internships) are announced on our social platforms. If no active listing is available, it means we currently cannot welcome new talent — but your interest truly means a lot to us.",

  "faq_q8": "Do you accept collaborations with other creators?",
  "faq_r8": "Absolutely! We are open to partnerships with artists, musicians, or studios whose vision aligns with ours. Contact us through our form or at contact@beebridgesinteractive.com.",
